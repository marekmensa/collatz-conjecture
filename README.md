# Collatz conjecture
This project serves as a simple validation of an old and still unresolved mathematical problem called [Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture).

---

   The problem can be summarized as follows:
   >
       "Take any positive integer n. If n is an even number, divide it by 2 to get n / 2.
        If n is an odd number, multiply it by 3, add 1 to get 3n + 1. Repeat this process indefinitely.
        The assumption is that it doesn't matter what starting number n is
        chosen - the resulting sequence always ends up with 1."
        
        
The sequence of these numbers is sometimes also called ice hail sequence (because the value of numbers in the sequence often drops and increases many times, similarly as hail changes their height when they are formed in the clouds).
